# Hypothesis Tests for Mean difference 

#Since the two confidence intervals overlap in the analysis above we would like to test the hypothesis 
# whether or not the mean rating for Steven Spielberg is different from that of Tim Burton.

# In effect we are testing for difference in means. 

# H_0 = M_1 - M_2 = 0 (The two means are not significantly different)
# H_1 = M_1 - M_2 â‰  0 (There is statistically significant difference between the two means)

# We first create a simulation of random outcomes using the bootstrap method

specify(rating ~ director) %>%

  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))

hyp_visualize %>% visualise() + geom_rect(xmin=0.975, xmax=1, ymin=10, ymax=200, color="red", fill="red", alpha=0.1)

# We can reject the null hypothesis as we can clearly see that the distribution's tails end at approx. 0.8 and -0.8

# We now calculate a P-value to confirm the results of the simulation
hyp_visualize %>% 
get_pvalue(obs_stat =(7.57-6.93) , direction = "both")  
# The results again indicate that we can reject the null and that there indeed is statistically significant difference between the means

t.test(rating ~ director, data = hypothesis_test)
# Another metric we would like to look at is the t-stat, which in this instance equals 3, which further indicates a rejection of the null

# Having observed these results consistently across our different approaches we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there indeed is a difference between the two means.
